==Quick Start==

1. Ensure that the dependent projects (outlined below) are installed and that
the zookeeper server is running. `make env` can be used to install the
dependent projects.

2. Using Openstack, with the gridcentric extensions installed, boot a new
instance. Install the VMS agent in this instance, and deploy your favorite
sample application.  You'll also need to deploy a hook in /etc/gridcentric/clone.d
which registers with Pancake when cloning occurs, something like:

'''/etc/gridcentric/clone.d/90_pancake'''
   #!/bin/bash
   while true; do
       curl -X POST <http://this-pancake-url/v1.0/register> && break
   done

Once this is done and the instance is running your demo app, bless the instance.

3. Modify the example service.conf. In particular update the nova/instance_id
to point to the newly created instance.

4. Run the scale manager server
$ sudo bin/pancake -z localhost:2181 runserver

5. Run the scale manager API that allows communication with the scale manager.
$ bin/pancake -z localhost:2181 runapi

6. Create a new service to autoscale, using the example service.conf.
$ bin/pancake manage testscale < example/service.conf

7. The scale manager will now manage the service, and launch new instances up
to the specified minimum number of instances. The load balancer configuration
will also be modified once the in-guest agent has registered with the manager
so that we know the IP is up and running.

==Dependencies==

nginx (optional)
    The default load balancer used by pancake.

dnsmasq (optional)
    Required if you are using the 'dnsmasq' load balancer.

zookeeper (3.4.x) (http://zookeeper.apache.org/)
    This the main datastore / control mechanism.
    You must also install the python bindings. 

mako (http://www.makotemplates.org/)
    A simple python templating engine used to update load balancer configurations.

pyramid (http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/1.2-branch/index.html)
    A simple web framework used by the API.

python-netifaces
    A python module for querying network interfaces.

==Project Contents==

bin
    Contains scripts that are used to start and configure the Pancake service / API.

gridcentric
    The top-level python package.
